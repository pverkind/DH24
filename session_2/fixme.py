# NB= Anything that follows a "#" (hash) in a script is a comment:
# a comment is meant only for humans to read, the script ignores it.

# This script below contains a lot of mistakes. 
# It's your task to correct them.

# Check every line to see if it contains a mistake.
# First "comment out" that line by putting a # before it,
# and copy the line of code (without the #) to a new line.
# Make your corrections to the copied line,
# and explain in a comment what you changed to make the code work!

# Like this:

#print("Hello World!')
print("Hello World!")   # the quotation marks were unbalanced: " vs '

# Run this script (Run > Run Module; or press F5)
# to find out if you fixed all mistakes in the script.
# If something is wrong, Python will stop executing the script
# and display an error message.
# The message may be pretty cryptic but at least it will tell you
# in which line of code it found its first mistake. 
# NB: sometimes, the mistake is in the line(s) before the error indicated in the message!

# The exercise is ready when it prints the positive message at the end!

# OK, your turn:
