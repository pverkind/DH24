The Events of the Year 
25 (OCTOBER 28, 645- October 16, 646) 

According to the account related to me by Abmad b. Thabit al-Razi—a traditionist (mulyiddith)—IshLaq b. 'Isa—Abil Ma'shar: The conquest of Alexandria took place in the year 25. According to al-Waqidi: In this year, Alexandria repudiated its pact, and 'Amr b. al-`As launched a bloody attack on them.2° We [that is, al-Tabari) have previously cited the report (of this event), mentioning also those who disagree with Abu. Ma'shar and al-Waqidi concerning the date. 1281o1 Also according to al-Waqidi: In this year, 'Abdallah b. Sa'd b. Abi Sarh sent cavalry forces against the Maghrib. (Al-Waqidi) says: 'Amr b. al-'As had previously sent an expedition to the Maghrib. They seized booty, and 'Abdallah sought and received permission from ('Amr) to raid Ifriqiyah.21 
ja-ghazahum 'Amu b. wa-qatalahum. Literally, "'Amr attacked and killed them." 21. Ifriqiyah: the Roman-Byzantine province of Africa Proconsularis, essen-tially the northern half of modern Tunisia.
