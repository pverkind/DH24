# 3. Observe the printed output. Each OpenITI text has a metadata
#    header. Find out what pattern matches the end of the metadata header.
#    Use the regex.split() function or the <string>.split() method
#    to split the metadata header off from the body of the text
#    NB: remember that to access the first element of a list,
#    you use [0]!
#    Print the first 500 characters of the body to make sure
#    you have correctly removed the metadata header:

# 5. The headings in an OpenITI text all start with three hashes: `###`
#    The hashes are followed by a space,
#    and then one or more pipe `|` characters.
#    If a heading has two pipes, it's a subheading of the previous
#    heading with one pipe.
#    Match all second-level headings (two pipes) in the text
#    (not only the tags but also the title)
#    NB: remember that the pipe is a special character in regular expressions!
